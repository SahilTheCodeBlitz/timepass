let see the entire template of professional project setup for backend

step 1 = npm init

step 2 = add readme.md

step 3 = create a public folder and inside a public folder create temp 
        folder

        though we store images or video files on third party cloud
        platfrom but still we need to store a temporary copy of
        those at server this folder is for the same

        we cannot push empty folder to github so just create
        .gitkeep file inside temp it is empty file

step 4 = create the gitignore file in the root directory
      
        One can use the gitigone generaator to generate this
        fle automatically

step 5 = Create .env file       

step 6 = Create a src folder where actual coding will be done

        This help in managing the code files well

step 7 = Create  three files in src folder
         index.js,constants.js, app.js

step 8 = Edit the package.json file

         8.1 ] add type = 'module'
         8.2 ] change the script section add new script for running
                
                "dev" :"nodemon src/index.js"

                to run  = npm run dev

step 9 = Create important folders in src

        1] controllers = function having logic for route handling
        2] db = database connection logic
        3] middlewares = function logic before serving request
        4] models = database model structures
        5] routes = have all the routes
        6] utils = utilities means write those function where you 
                    need that function at many places




step 9 = Install nodemon 
          npm i -D nodemon // this is used only for development   

          nodemon will be added to dev dependency                       


step 10 = install prettier 

          prettier make sures ki agar ek project 4 jan milke bana 
          rhe hai to uniformity ho code me sab same standard 
          follow kare if suppose someone uses ; and some not it
          may cause conflict to resolve this we define rules
          to follow uniformity



          step 10.1 ] npm i -D prettier // prettier is dev dependency

          step 10.2 ] create a file .prettierrc in root directory 

                      then specifies rules here like

                      {
                        "singleQuote": false,
                        "bracketSpacing": true,
                        "tabWidth": 2,
                        "semi": true,
                        "trailingComma": "es5"
                      }

         step 10.3] create a .prettierignore file in root directory

                    Here you specify those files where you want 
                    preetier rules should not be applied 
                    because if applied to .env it would just change its 
                    format

                    /.vscode
                    /node_modules
                    ./dist

                    *.env
                    .env
                    .env.*

                    // iske bhi file generator milta hai

step 11 ] git pe upload  karo ji
