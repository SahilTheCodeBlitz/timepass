Working on the backend frontend connectivity

sending data from backend that is from backend to frontend 
and displaying jokes data at front end using react framework

if you write this code in frontend

useEffect(()=>{

    axios.get('http:localhost:4000/api/jokes').then((response)=>{

      // success code

      setJokes(response.data) // setting the jokes data


    }).catch((error)=>{

      console.log(error);

    })

    the biggest problem will be cors i.e cross origin resource sharing error
    that will block the request comming from different origin

    agar apka url alag hai , port number alag hai use cross origin kha
    jata hai


    number of way s to tackle this

    1] Whitelisting

        you ask the backend developers to whitelist the url of front end
        so that your front end request can be served by the server

        Problem = the url say http://localhost:5173/ is front end url
        if you white list it but the url will be changed on production server 
        this will cause the issue so bad idea

        Solution = PRoduction pe dalne ke bad ye sab change karo Whitelisting
        parameters

    2] using cors

        do whotelisting or add headers options at backend but still same 
        problem

    3] Better Solution Using Proxy server 

    Add the proxy setting in vite.config.js and then to resolve same problem 
    now we will chane the localhost address with the server address
    at production

    proxy:{
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:4000',
        changeOrigin: true, // This ensures the request is seen as originating from the target server.
        
      },

    Note = deploy backend and front end server separetly
