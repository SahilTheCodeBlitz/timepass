One good practice is whwnever you get any task to store data and all
say login details before starting the coding try to understand requirements
required fields and then start  clearly understand what we have to store


DATA MODELING =  data modeling means data ka pura structure define karna 

lets see approach in industry for backend project


very firstly we have to see the requirement what are fields that  we 
have to store in database what are features requirements

then by using model drawing tool we can graphically design the 
layput to understand what are data field and how components are related to 
each other

then we create a model in database using monggose i.e create the sructure 
of the database and specifies all the important fileds needed

we are going to create three database models for our understading

model 1 = todos model
