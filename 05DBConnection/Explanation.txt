Tut 5 = Connection with mongodb 

STEPS on mongodb cloud

step1 = create new project (Project Name = ChaiAurCode)
step2 = create the cluster 
step3 = get user name and paswwrod ans save it in .env
step4 = create user
step5 = copy the connection string and paste in .env
step6 = remove / from the string
step7 = give ip address access
step8 = in constant.js write database name

setup complete knnow we have allthe credentials

 

There are two ways  to connect with mongodb

1] Way is to write code in index.js to connect 
2] write connection code in db folder and then export it in index.js

second approach widely used but we will see both

approach 1  = 

it is necessary to establish the connection with database firstly
before any task so writitn the connection logic in iffe fucniton

(()=>{//logic})()

database is always present at another continent so we have to 
use async await as time will be taken to establish the connection
with database

always write connection code in try catch block because very high
chances error will come while connection

this is the connection string
mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGOCONNECTIONURI}/${DBNAME}`)

DBNAME we have stroed in the constant.js

approach2 = 

Lets make a file in DB FOLDER there we will write function for connection
and willl import it in index.js

also code for express package likke listen , routes we will write it in
app.js and will import it to index.js

step 1 = create connection.js file in db folder and write code there
         for mongoose connection 

         and then in index.js file just import dontenv and in async await 
         call the function 

         job done







Tutorial = Custom API response and error handling







First create app using express in app.js and export it to index.js
then app.listen if mongodb connection successfull

next thing we are doing is using different inbuilt middlewares to 
handle different request 

CORS middlewares 

   We are using cors middlewares , cors middleware are used to handle
   cross origin resource sharing policies 
   We can have several option here main aim is to decide which another
   origin request to be allowed 
   can refer documentation for further processes

app.use(cors({
    origin:process.env.CORSORIGIN,// specified in the dotenv which origi to allow
}))



// middleware to handle the json data also setting the limit i.e size 
// of the json data

// parses the json data coming from request.body

app.use(express.json({limit:"16kb"}))


// middleware to handle the request data which is in the form of the url

app.use(express.urlencoded({limit:"16kb",extended:true}))

// this is middleware function that serves static files such as images, CSS files, 
//JavaScript files, and other assets from a specified directory.
// This is useful for web applications that need to deliver these 
// assets directly to the client's browser.

app.use(express.static('public'))

// cookie parser middleware allow to store cookie at client side
// or manipulate cookie from server

app.use(cookieParser())


Explanation about middleware






Creating utility functions to handle api error and api response 
i.e error we get and response we send to client

isse ak standard format jo hum define karenge usi format me error  ki
information ayegi and same goes for the response


creating utility function for the error handling

step 1= go to node api error package link = https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#class-error

we want to use this Error class to create the error and use 
the  information given by this class to understand more about
error and create a general structure of what the error will define

step 2 = utils me apiError.js name ki file create karo

then we are extending the Error class so we can get more information
about error and use Erro class benefits to create the structured error
for all the errors that we are going to encounter 

created the constructor there we accepted parameters and using 'this'
keyword stored that varaible as the class variable 

using super keyword we called the parent class that is  Error class
constructor we need to pass the message there now what it
does is it gives info about stack of the error and we can store
this stack as a variable belongingn to apiError class

After when we call the Erro class so whatever variables are 
set we will get a object of all this information as the output



Creating utility function for apiResponse

just creating contructor  that will accept the fields which has
to be specifiedd while creatinf the object of the class and 
as a result we will get strucutred object of how the response will look 
likke









Tutorial = User and Video model with hooks and jwt and bcrypt


So firstly lets make the User and Video model

Go in model folder and create user.model.js and video.model.js

user.model.js

we xreated a model defining various fileds but there are few fields
that we should look up to first one is watchedHistory this is field 
where we are taking array of the Video object and this is 
that one field that gonna make the project more complex

video.model.js

created a model to have a schema in mongodb normal fields


watchedHistory special field handling

Actually we require the another package that we will use as plugin
mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2

this package allows us to write the aggregation  query
i.e we can say complex query see docs = aggregation pipeline in mongodb

Best explanation why we need this package
Mongoose-paginate-v2 is a plugin for Mongoose, a popular Node.js
 library that helps you work with MongoDB databases. If your project
  involves displaying a large set of data (like a list of users, posts
  , or products), showing all the data at once can be overwhelming and
   slow down your application. Instead, you might want to show the
    data in smaller, more manageable chunks, or "pages."

Mongoose-paginate-v2 makes it easy to add pagination to your data
 queries. It allows you to retrieve only a specific number of records
  at a time (like the first 10, then the next 10, and so on),
   and gives you tools to navigate between these pages.
    This way, your users can view the data one page at a time, 
    making the experience smoother and more user-friendly.

hum array of video dikhayage paginate will make sure ki sare video na load
ho bas jo chchiye ya recent;y vo hi ho      



npm install mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2 

in video.model.js

then import it

and then schamaname.plugin(mongooseGrregateplugin)



lets come to user.model.js

lets come to password field we cannot directly store password
as it is  we need to encrypt it and store also need to compare
the encrypted password so for that puppse we need to use bcrypt

another thing that we require is jsonwebtoken

ok now we have to hash the password to do so what we gonna do is
we want to implement password hash method just before model is saved todo 
so we require the hook called pre and in that 'save' as the event list
ener and inside that whaterver code we write it will be executed before 
svinf the data to database

in pre hook dont use callback function as we will have no access to 
schema data as callback has no access to this keyword

injectiing methods in schema


uske bad humne input password and database passwrod compare karne 
ke liye bhi ek method banaya jo humne as a property schema
me dala let see usko kaise use karenge aage


then we created two method which belong to schema to create access 
token and refresh token using sign method by jwt 

why we require this two tokens ....

Tutorial = How to upload file in backend 

Adding file to temporary storage and from that storage to third party
cloud platform
Then using cloud url to access the file 

strategy = first we will store the file that we get from front end 
            to our local server temporary and then from that temporary
            storage to cloudinary

We have to create the utility function or middleware for file
upload lets crete the middleware



First signin to the cloudinary  and see the documenetation

then npm i cloudinary
     npm i multer

Create cloudinaryFileUpload.js

created the function that take's  filepath and then upload the 
the file to the cloudinary and unlinks the file from the 
local temporary storage


create a middleware to store the file as a temporary storage in server

check code in middleware folder
multer.middleware.js

// me isko as a middleware use karunga route me
// if mujhw laga us route pe file ayegi o i will use this
// middleware function 

// app.post('/profile', upload.storage('storage'), function (req, res, next) {
    // req.file is the `avatar` file
    // req.body will hold the text fields, if there were any
//   })



HTTP crash course


// letss get starting with actual coding

// just creating a standardised code to avoid wrting try
catch at every controllers code

creating a asynchronous  function handling utility

steps = got to utility and create asynchandler.js
        this is the wrapper fucntion which executes error handler
        middleware as soon as error occurs if no error occurs our controllers
        function will execute normally


lets now create a register route and handle it
